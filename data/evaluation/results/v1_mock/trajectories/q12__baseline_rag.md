- observation: Siddhartha's own dossier states his senior leadership experience has been at chief level only for the recent part of a ten-year career, in technology organizations rather than membership institutions, and that government/policy relationship-building experience at the secretariat level is being built, not inherited. Siddhartha's own dossier states he has no prior record of building or running a professional membership body such as CII, NASSCOM, FICCI, or AIMA, and explicitly says the committee should not be persuaded that adjacent experience (student chapters, alumni association membership) is equivalent to that record.
